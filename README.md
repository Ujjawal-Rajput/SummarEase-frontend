# SummarEase

## Inspiration
1. The inspiration for this project came from the need to streamline the process of extracting valuable insights from documents and user prompts. 
2. Whether summarizing lengthy text or generating quiz questions for education, the goal was to build an intuitive **AI-powered tool** that simplifies content analysis.

## What it does
The project allows users to:
1. **Summarize text** from user prompts or uploaded PDF/DOC files.
2. **Generate quiz questions** from documents or direct input.
3. **Generate flashcards** containing headings and descriptions based on user prompts.
4. **Ask AI anything**, providing quick and intelligent responses.

## How we built it
1. **Flask** for the backend to handle API requests and file uploads.
2. **Google Generative AI** for advanced NLP tasks like summarization, question generation, and flashcards generation.
3. **Text extractors** for reading and processing PDF/DOC files.
4. **Recoil** for managing frontend state and **ReactJS** for the user interface.
5. Seamless interaction between user input and AI-driven processing for a better user experience.

## Challenges we ran into
1. **Integrating AI models** with diverse system roles for different tasks.
2. I did not know about **Recoil**, so I learned and implemented it simultaneously.
3. Designing a backend that handles different prompts for **summary**, **quiz**, and **flashcards**.
4. Creating a **responsive UI** and **good state management** to deliver real-time results.
5. Generating unique **session IDs** for each chapter (chat) and navigating conversations effectively.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Built an **all-in-one tool** that handles text summarization, quiz generation, and flashcards generation.
2. Efficiently **integrated AI** to understand and respond to diverse user prompts.
3. Provided users with an **easy-to-use interface** for both uploading documents and entering prompts.

## What we learned
1. Learned **Recoil** for state management.
2. Learned **AI integration** using Google Generative AI.
3. Learned building APIs using **Flask (Python)**.

## What's next for SummarEase
1. **Fine-tune** this project.
2. **Scale up** the project to handle more users efficiently.
3. Attract a **larger number of users** to SummarEase.
